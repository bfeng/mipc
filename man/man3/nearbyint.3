double ceil(double \fIx\fP);
double floor(double \fIx\fP);
double nearbyint(double \fIx\fP);
double trunc(double \fIx\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions round the specified floating point number to a nearby integer.
For nearbyint, the rounding mode is determined by the value set using the
fesetround function. The other functions are not influenced by the rounding 
mode. The ceil function rounds upwards, selecting the smallest integer that is
larger than or equal to \fIx\fP. The floor function rounds downwards, selecting
the largest integer that is smaller than or equal to \fIx\fP. The trunc function
rounds towards zero, selecting the largest integer with the largest absolute 
value of which the absolute value is smaller than or equal to the absolute 
value of \fIx\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The functions return an integer close to \fIx\fP.
